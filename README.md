# React Notes

### What is React?
--> JavaScript Library for building User Interfaces.
	It is about building JavaScript-driven apps. React apps run in the browser, not on the server.
	React is all about using Components for building UI.
	
### Components?
--> React components can be thought of as custom HTML elements.
	In the end, you are just writing custom HTML elements.

### React DOM?
--> React DOM is about rendering components to the real DOM.

### ReactDOM.render();
--> This render() method allows us to render a JavaScript function as a component to the real DOM 
	and that treating it as a component part is exactly what React takes care about.

### * We output dynamic content in React with { }.

### Redux?
--> Independent third-party library

### Component basics
React will call render() method to render something to the screen.
Every React Component has to return or render some html code which can be rendered to the DOM to the screen.

### Creating a Functional Component
Start with a capital letter for your component files.
A component is just a function which returns some jsx, some html.
