# React Notes

### What is React?
--> JavaScript Library for building User Interfaces.
	It is about building JavaScript-driven apps. React apps run in the browser, not on the server.
	React is all about using Components for building UI.
	
### Components?
--> React components can be thought of as custom HTML elements.
	In the end, you are just writing custom HTML elements.

### React DOM?
--> React DOM is about rendering components to the real DOM.

### ReactDOM.render();
--> This render() method allows us to render a JavaScript function as a component to the real DOM 
	and that treating it as a component part is exactly what React takes care about.

### * We output dynamic content in React with { }.

### Redux?
--> Independent third-party library
